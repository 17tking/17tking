# What's up! I'm Tavish King 

I use github to present some of the data projects I work on to help me upskill. I have created these projects on my own so they're not always crisp like a youtube walkthrough. Mostly, my repos showcase where I am growing in my field of data analysis/engineering. Forever a passionate learner and forever tying in my hobbies with my career. Find the balance!
## About Me

My favorite part of data analysis is designing the visual I'll use for a report or presentation. It brings out my creative side to working.

Lately, I've elevated my career to the engineering side of data, or getting it from one spot to the next. My Utah Mountain Conditions repo showcases this. Before I set off on a 15 mile roundtrip hike to Mt.*watchamacallit*, this data that I've engineered from start to finish will let me know the forecast and conditions that I should prepare for, keeping both my friends or I safe. 

I love Legos, reading, and lately trying out golf, but we will see how that goes. You do not want to see my swing yet...

Feel free to talk to me about any of these hobbies or projects of mine on whatever Social Channel you feel most comfortable on!
